# Problem
You have N airports and M airplanes. Between each airport, you assume that it will take T timestep for a shuttle to move between. You are trying to serve requests from aiport A to B. You are trying to build a strategy that serves requests coming in. We define a strategy as a sequence of choices at every timestep You want to come up with "best" strategy.

# Metric
1. Average weight time.
2. x% quantile weight time.
3. minimum "idle" time

All of these metrics seem reasonable and it's unclear how they related to each other under different strategy. 

# Strategy Brainstorm
1. greedy (find the )


# Modelling
1. Model arrival rate of people at an airport as

# Engineering Approach
